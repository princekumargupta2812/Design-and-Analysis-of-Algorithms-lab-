Greedy Approach :
On each iteration we pick one item which have 
heightest cost and then check we can include 
it or not , if yes then we include it . 

This algorithm may not give optimal solution .
Let see one case .
  ======================= 
   value :  20, 12,10,5
   weight : 15, 5 ,5, 2
   wt-limit : 16
  =======================
if we go by above algorithm 
then we first take 20 and our wt-limit reduce to (16-15).
Now we can able to pick any items
So, the total cost is 20 

But 
if we choose items with value 12 ,10, 5
then total cost is 27 and the total weight is 12(5+5+2) which is less than 
weight limit 16.So greedy algorithm will not give optimal solution always.
